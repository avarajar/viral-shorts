            <ul>
                <li><strong>OAuth Tokens:</strong> When you authorize the app to post on your behalf (e.g., TikTok, YouTube), we store authentication tokens locally on our secure server. These tokens are used solely to publish content to your account.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Content Data:</strong> We access publicly available content from platforms like Reddit to generate video scripts. No private or personal user data is collected from these sources.</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>

            <h3>4. Data Storage and Security</h3>
            <p>All authentication tokens are stored locally on a private, secured server. Tokens are never shared with third parties, sold, or used for any purpose other than publishing content to the authorized account. We use industry-standard security practices to protect stored data.</p>

            <h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>
